For Raj Joseph,

I had followed Plural Sight but got a liitle confused on the 7th part but it did explain a lot concerninc the
MVC model, regardless I was able to create the necessary form for the final, but using a different tutorial found in the 
following link:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio

I got up to "Controllers Actions and Views" section. Please let me know if this doesn't work, I really don't use GitHub
as much as I should, so I'm afriad I make a mistake.
